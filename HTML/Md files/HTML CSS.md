# HTML  CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

## What is CSS?

Cascading Style sheets is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are postioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screens sizes, and much more!

**Tip:** The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
