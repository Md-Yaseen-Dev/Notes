# HTML Class

The HTML class Attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

## Using the class Attribute

The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a javascript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

In the following example we have three '<div>' elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three '<div>' elwments will be styled equally according to the .city style defintion in the head section:

```html
<div class="city">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Tokyo</h2>
  <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
</div>
```
