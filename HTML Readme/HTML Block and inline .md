## HTML Block and Inline Elements

<b>Block-level Element :-</b>
A block- level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automaticallly add some spaces before and after element.
_for example :-_

`<p> This paragraph is a block-level element; its background has been colored to display the paragraph's parent element.</p>`

<b>Inline-level Element :- </b>
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is a span element inside a paragraph.

This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black"> Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.

<b>Div element:-</b>

The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The div element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
